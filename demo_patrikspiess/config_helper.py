"""Do the main configuration

This Module loads and defines the main Configuration for the tool. It is meant to load the
configuration from a YAML file into a python dict.

Possible configurations are:

logging (list)
    The logging setting contains a list of logging configurations. As many loggers as needed may be
    configured.

logging.item (dict)
    A logging item is a dict with all the settings needed for the respective logger

logging.item.type (str)
    Define the type of log (log or audit)

    "log"
        defines that the logger is a normal logger
    "auditlog"
        defines that the logger is an audit logger

    Any other string set in type wil lbe ignored

logging.item.level (str)
    Define the og level from one of the following:
    "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL"
    In you omit the level the default level of INFO is used

logging.item.destination (str)
    Define the logging destination

    "console"
        Log to the console to stdout

    "file:FILENAME"
        Log to a file. You must specify a FILENAME.

    "syslog:HOSTNAME:PORT
        Log to a SYSLOG server.
        You must define a HOSTNAME
        If you omit PORT the default port 514 will be used
